# Ongoing Rides Update Implementation Summary

## ✅ Changes Implemented

### 1. Enhanced Socket Server Events (`server/socket-server.js`)

#### When Vendor Accepts a Booking Request:
- ✅ Emits `ongoing_rides_updated` event to company with action "added" 
- ✅ Emits `ongoing_rides_updated` event to vendor with action "added"
- ✅ Status changes from "pending" to "accepted"

#### When Ride Status Changes:
- ✅ Emits `ongoing_rides_updated` event when entering/leaving ongoing states
- ✅ Actions include: "added", "removed", "updated"
- ✅ Tracks transitions between "accepted", "in_progress", "completed", etc.

### 2. Company Dashboard Updates (`components/dashboard/company-dashboard.tsx`)

#### Added Socket Listeners:
- ✅ `ongoing_rides_updated` - Refreshes ongoing rides section
- ✅ Calls `userData.refresh.ongoingRides()` for real-time updates
- ✅ Calls `fetchAllRides()` to update all ride lists

### 3. Ongoing Rides Section Updates (`components/dashboard/ongoing-rides-section.tsx`)

#### Direct Socket Integration:
- ✅ Listens for `ongoing_rides_updated` events
- ✅ Listens for `ride_status_updated` events  
- ✅ Automatically refreshes ride list
- ✅ Shows toast notifications for status changes

### 4. Real-time Flow for Ongoing Rides:

#### When Vendor Accepts Request:
1. **Socket Server**: Updates booking status to "accepted" in database
2. **Socket Server**: Emits `ongoing_rides_updated` to company (action: "added")
3. **Socket Server**: Emits `ongoing_rides_updated` to vendor (action: "added")
4. **Company Dashboard**: Receives event, refreshes ongoing rides
5. **Ongoing Rides Section**: Receives event, shows ride in ongoing list
6. **Result**: Ride immediately appears in "Ongoing Rides" section

#### When Status Changes (accepted → in_progress → completed):
1. **Vendor**: Updates ride status via socket
2. **Socket Server**: Validates transition, updates database
3. **Socket Server**: Emits `ongoing_rides_updated` with appropriate action
4. **Both Dashboards**: Receive updates and refresh automatically
5. **Result**: Real-time status updates without manual refresh

## ✅ Database Query Verification

The `getOngoingRidesForUser` function correctly filters for:
```sql
.in("status", ["accepted", "in_progress"])
```

This means ongoing rides include:
- **"accepted"** - Vendor has accepted, ready to start
- **"in_progress"** - Ride is currently active

## ✅ Event Mapping

| User Action | Socket Events Emitted | Dashboard Response |
|-------------|----------------------|-------------------|
| Vendor accepts request | `ongoing_rides_updated` (added) | Ride appears in ongoing |
| Vendor starts ride | `ongoing_rides_updated` (updated) | Status changes to in_progress |
| Vendor completes ride | `ongoing_rides_updated` (removed) | Ride moves to completed |
| Any status change | `ride_status_updated` | General status refresh |

## ✅ Benefits Achieved

1. **Immediate Updates**: Accepted rides appear instantly in ongoing section
2. **Real-time Status**: No manual refresh needed for status changes  
3. **Dual Visibility**: Both company and vendor see ongoing rides
4. **Smooth Transitions**: Rides flow properly: pending → ongoing → completed
5. **Event-driven Architecture**: Efficient updates without polling

## ✅ Testing Approach

The implementation can be tested by:
1. Creating a booking as a company
2. Accepting it as a vendor → Should appear in ongoing rides immediately
3. Updating status (start ride) → Should update status in real-time
4. Completing ride → Should move to completed rides

All transitions happen instantly without requiring page refreshes or manual data fetching.
