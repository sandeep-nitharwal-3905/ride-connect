# Pending Rides Update Implementation

## Overview
This implementation ensures that the "Pending Rides" section in the company dashboard updates in real-time when:
1. A new ride is created
2. A pending ride is accepted by a vendor
3. A ride status changes from/to pending

## Changes Made

### 1. Socket Server Updates (`server/socket-server.js`)

#### Added Real-time Events for Ride Creation:
```javascript
// When a booking is created successfully
socket.emit("ride_created", {
  booking: booking,
  requestId: requestId,
  status: "pending"
})

socket.to(`company:${companyId}`).emit("pending_rides_updated", {
  booking: booking,
  action: "created"
})
```

#### Added Real-time Events for Booking Acceptance:
```javascript
// When a vendor accepts a booking
socket.to(`company:${companyId}`).emit("pending_rides_updated", {
  booking: booking,
  action: "accepted"
})
```

#### Added Real-time Events for Status Changes:
```javascript
// When ride status changes that affects pending state
if (newStatus === "pending" || currentBooking.status === "pending") {
  socket.to(`company:${companyId}`).emit("pending_rides_updated", {
    booking: updatedBooking,
    action: "status_changed",
    oldStatus: currentBooking.status,
    newStatus: newStatus
  })
}
```

### 2. Company Dashboard Updates (`components/dashboard/company-dashboard.tsx`)

#### Added Socket Event Listeners:
```typescript
// Listen for ride creation events
socket.on("ride_created", handleRideCreated)
socket.on("pending_rides_updated", handlePendingRidesUpdated)
socket.on("booking_request_created", handleBookingRequestCreated)
```

#### Event Handlers:
- `handleRideCreated`: Refreshes all rides when a new ride is created
- `handlePendingRidesUpdated`: Refreshes all rides when pending rides are updated
- `handleBookingRequestCreated`: Refreshes all rides when booking creation is confirmed

### 3. Create Booking Dialog Updates (`components/dashboard/create-booking-dialog.tsx`)

#### Added Callback Support:
```typescript
interface CreateBookingDialogProps {
  // ... existing props
  onBookingCreated?: () => void
}
```

#### Parent Refresh Callback:
```typescript
const handleBookingRequestCreated = (data) => {
  // ... existing logic
  if (onBookingCreated) {
    onBookingCreated() // Refresh parent component
  }
}
```

## Real-time Event Flow

### When a Company Creates a Ride:
1. Company submits booking form
2. Socket server creates booking in database
3. Server emits multiple events:
   - `booking_request_created` → Company (confirmation)
   - `ride_created` → Company (for dashboard refresh)
   - `pending_rides_updated` → Company (specific update)
   - `new_booking_request` → All vendors
4. Company dashboard receives events and refreshes pending rides list

### When a Vendor Accepts a Ride:
1. Vendor clicks accept on booking request
2. Socket server updates booking status to "accepted"
3. Server emits events:
   - `booking_status_update` → Company
   - `pending_rides_updated` → Company (removes from pending)
   - `booking_acceptance_confirmed` → Vendor
4. Company dashboard refreshes and ride moves from pending to ongoing

### When a Ride Status Changes:
1. Status update request is sent to server
2. Server validates transition and updates database
3. If status involves pending state, server emits:
   - `ride_status_updated` → Company and Vendor
   - `pending_rides_updated` → Company (if relevant)
4. Company dashboard refreshes automatically

## Testing Results

The implementation was tested with a simulation script that:
- ✅ Connected as both company and vendor
- ✅ Created a test booking request
- ✅ Verified all real-time events were received
- ✅ Confirmed vendor could accept the booking
- ✅ Verified status updates propagated correctly

## Benefits

1. **Real-time Updates**: Pending rides appear immediately after creation
2. **Automatic Refresh**: No manual refresh needed when rides change status
3. **Better UX**: Users see live updates without page reloads
4. **Consistent State**: All connected clients stay synchronized
5. **Event-driven**: Reduces unnecessary API calls and database queries

## Usage

The pending rides section will now automatically:
- Show new rides immediately after creation
- Remove rides when they're accepted by vendors
- Update when ride statuses change
- Maintain real-time synchronization across all company dashboard instances

No additional configuration is required - the feature works automatically when the socket server and Next.js application are running.
